| [oauth-cli](./packages/oauth-cli)                                           | A Node utility that opens the Oauth URL, starts an express server which listens for the redirect when the user logs in. the Redirect Server makes a request to the tokenUrl and returns back the token in the response. It resolves the promise of the OAuthCLI with the token                                                                       | Working |
| [generate-oauth-token-cli](./package/../packages/generate-oauth-token-cli/) | Generates an oauth token using the CLI and saves it to a file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Working |
| [exec-bash-command](./packages/exec-bash-command)                           | This is a utility that should run any bash command or CLI. It supports sending inputs to the command, checks for exit codes, and allows to check the `stdout` and `stderr` easily with a promise interface. It also allows to run node scripts easily (that are meant to be run as CLIs)                                                             | Working |
| [test-cli](./package/test-cli)                                              | This is a generic utility that should be able to test any CLI. It's meant to be used in the context of Jest as it exports mock functions that fire when there's data on `stdout` or `stderr`                                                                                                                                                         | Working |
| [send-inputs-to-cli](./packages/send-inputs-to-cli/)                        | This is a generic utility that should be able to send inputs to any CLI/process executed by `child_process.exec`. It's meant to be used in the context of Jest as it exports mock functions that fire when there's data on `stdout` or `stderr`. It is also mean to be used in conjunction with [`@node-cli-toolkit/test-cli`](./packages/test-cli/) | Working |
| [save-token](./package/../packages/save-token)                              | A small utility to write your tokens to the file system to easily retrieve later                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Working |
| [\_\_template](./packages/__template)                                       | A boilerplate to copy to create more packages                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Working |
